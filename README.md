# Flickr
Flickr App

This is basically a search engine for flickr photos. We take an input from the user and use it with the api to fetch images from Flickr.

The user can search for images and Upvote/Downvote them according to preference.

The node server interacts with the Golang server which intern interacts with either the Db or the Flickr API to do the various tasks.
